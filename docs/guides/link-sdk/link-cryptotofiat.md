The crypto to fiat functionality is available in SDK v1.21.3+ and is a collaboration between Immutable X and Moonpay.

The exchange process allows users to sell crypto held on L2 on the Immutable X platform directly for fiat funds. These funds will be deposited directly into the users nominated bank account. There is no gas fee for this exchange, only a [Moonpay transaction fee](https://support.moonpay.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360011930117-What-fees-do-you-charge-).

The withdraw happens directly on L2 via the transfer to Moonpay accounts.

To initialize the offramp process with an option to choose any available currency and amount, marketplace needs to call the offramp function:

```typescript
await link.cryptoToFiat({})
```

This displays the Link UI with a screen when a user need to choose currency and anter amount:

To initialize the offramp process for a specific currency:
```typescript
await link.cryptoToFiat({ cryptoCurrencies: ['ETH'] })
```

This displays the Link UI with a screen when a user can only enter amount with already populated currency:

![Offramp with specific currency](../../../static/img/link-sdk-cryptotofiat/offramp-with-currency.png 'Offramp with specific currency')

To initialize the offramp process with defined currency and amount:

```typescript
await link.cryptoToFiat({ cryptoCurrencies: ['ETH'], amount: '0.01' })
```
This displays the Link UI with loaded Moonpay widget:
